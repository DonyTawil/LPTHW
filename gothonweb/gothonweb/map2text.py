context="""Long time ago, war raged all over earth. So a 
group of people now called "The Martians" decided to leave Mother Gaia,
and seek refuge on mars. Lacking the technical support and 
scientific innovations of the rest of humanity, these people succeded
in the colonization of mars but with grave consequences. Not being able
to withstand the harsh martian environment. These people mutated into 
barbaric zombie-like civilisation(and they fornicated like rabbits!!!,
so there's a lot of them).
Now the war is over. And humanity must conquer the sky, so it can provide
the necessary resources for its survival. And we have our eyes set
on Mars. But this Martian civilization might be too hostile. So we are sending
you to recon the area. Approach the mutants with extreme prejudice. Shoot on
sight if attacked!!!
Good luck! This mission is code-named:operation visiting-killzone"""
